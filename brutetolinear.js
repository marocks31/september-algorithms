//1. Given two arrays, return a new array that contains the intersection of the two arrays. The intersection means the values that are contained in both of the arrays. Do not use the "&", or any built-in intersection methods.

// NOTE: You must accomplish this in O(n) time. This is also known as linear time.

// Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
// Output: [1, 3, 5]

//2. Given two arrays, determine whether one is a subset of the other. It is considered a subset if all the values in one array are contained within the other.

// NOTE: You must accomplish this in O(n) time. This is also known as linear time.

// Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [6, 3, 2]
// Output: true

// Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [6, 3, 7]
// Output: false

//3. A given array has one pair of duplicate values. Return the first duplicate value.

// NOTE: You must accomplish this in O(n) time. This is also known as linear time.

// Input: [5, 2, 9, 7, 2, 6]
// Output: 2

//4. A given string contains all the letters from the alphabet except for one. Return the missing letter.

// NOTE: You must accomplish this in O(n) time. This is also known as linear time.

// Input: “The quick brown box jumps over a lazy dog”
// Output: “f”

// 5. Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

// NOTE: You must accomplish this in O(n) time. This is also known as linear time.

// Examples:

// s = "leetcode"
// return 0.
// (The "l" is the first character that only appears once in the string, and appears at index 0.)

// s = "loveleetcode",
// return 2.
// (The "l" and "o" are repeated, so the first non-repeating character is the "v", which is at index 2.)

// Note: You may assume the string contain only lowercase letters.

// 6. This is the same exercise as Two Sum I, but you must now solve it in linear time.

// Given an array of numbers, return a new array containing just two numbers (from the original array) that add up to the number 10. If there are no two numbers that add up to 10, return false.

// Input: [2, 5, 3, 1, 0, 7, 11]
// Output: [3, 7]

// Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
// Output: false (While 1, 2, 3, and 4 altogether add up to 10, we're seeking just one pair of numbers.)

// 7.
// This is very similar to ETL #3, but you must now accomplish the task in linear time (O(N)).

// Given an array of Youtube videos, for example:

// [
// {title: 'How to Make Wood', author_id: 4, views: 6},
// {title: 'How to Seem Perfect', author_id: 4, views: 111},
// {title: 'Review of the New "Unbreakable Mug"', author_id: 2, views: 202},
// {title: 'Why Pigs Stink', author_id: 1, views: 12}
// ]

// and an array of authors, for example:

// [
// {id: 1, first_name: 'Jazz', last_name: 'Callahan'},
// {id: 2, first_name: 'Ichabod', last_name: 'Loadbearer'},
// {id: 3, first_name: 'Saron', last_name: 'Kim'},
// {id: 4, first_name: 'Teena', last_name: 'Burgess'},
// ]

// Return a new array of videos in the following format, and only include videos that have at least 100 views:

// [
// {title: 'How to Seem Perfect', views: 111, author_name: 'Teena Burgess' }
// {title: 'Review of the New "Unbreakable Mug"', views: 202, author_name: 'Ichabod Loadbearer' },
// ]
